__Purpose of Analysis:__

The purpose of our analysis was to examine a large dataset of UFO sightings and be able to filter through different characteristics of the data using Javascript, HTML, & Developer Tools. This data contains certain parameters like city, state, country, date & description of sighting. This can be tablularly searched with the web application that we created. 

__Results & Instructions:__

The search is very simple. Simply type in your date, city, country, shape and as you are tabbing through the fields more data should be narrowed down based on these filters. Also, a user can choose to only type in a single parameter and it will populate that data.

__Here is an example for a California sighting:__

Summary:
This webpage is handy for quickly scanning through sightings if you know what you are searching for in the parameters. The data is limited to only 2010 and will not go beyond that date. It is also based on some user experiences with grammatical errors. Finally, there is no way to offload this data for others to analyze & share as it is very much a read-only website. 

Two recommendations I would make is first adding more data to the dataset to do a broader analysis. Next, I would allow users to better interact with the data besides the graphical serach. I would like for them to upload their own verified sightings and descriptions. This way our website could be more robust and serve the UFOlogist community better.
